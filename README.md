# SO-FCE: Self-Optimized Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method for Addressing Real-World Low-Quality Samples in WebRobot Detection 
### Description
This repository is the open source code for our paper entitled "SO-FCE: Self-Optimized Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method for Addressing Real-World Low-Quality Samples in WebRobot Detection", which is under review in IEEE xxxx.

We proposes a Web Robot behavior detection technique based on the self-optimizing fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The method provides an in-depth analysis of Web Robot's access behavior patterns from the session perspective,
and combines the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and iterative self-optimization learning to optimize the fuzzy decision-making parameters and improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection.

### Dataset
The web access data used in this study comes from the network server area traffic of a university. We extracted HTTP access log data from the network traffic.
Each record contains detailed information such as the source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, Host, Url, UserAgent, Referer, and access timestamp of the HTTP access.

### How to run the code?

The user guide is presented as follow.
